# victory-native

## Launch your own

[![Launch with Expo](https://github.com/expo/examples/blob/master/.gh-assets/launch.svg?raw=true)](https://launch.expo.dev/?github=https://github.com/expo/examples/tree/master/with-victory-native)

## How to use

## Running the app

- Run `yarn` or `npm install`
- Run `yarn start` or `npm run start`, to try it out!

## The idea behind the example

Expo includes `react-native-svg`, which is the only native dependency for `victory-native`. This demo shows that it's as simple as adding a supported version of `victory-native` and then using it as suggested in the docs. The code in `App.js` is copied directly out of the `victory-native` example app.
