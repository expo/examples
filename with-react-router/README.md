React Router is a universal routing solution that you can use with Expo!
This demo shows you how to setup your universal application to switch between web and native routers.

## Launch your own

[![Launch with Expo](https://github.com/expo/examples/blob/master/.gh-assets/launch.svg?raw=true)](https://launch.expo.dev/?github=https://github.com/expo/examples/tree/master/with-react-router)

### ⚽️ Running in the browser

- Create Expo project `expo init`
- Install the plugin: `yarn add react-router-dom react-router-native` or `npm install --save react-router-dom react-router-native`
- Create platform specific files to switch between web and native:
  - [`react-router.js`](https://github.com/expo/examples/blob/master/with-react-router/react-router.js) for web.
  - [`react-router.native.js`](https://github.com/expo/examples/blob/master/with-react-router/react-router.native.js) for iOS and Android.
- Now you can use these files to create your universal routes! [Basic Example](App.js)

### Deploying to Netlify

You may find get the following error when visiting URLs other than '/' on when your single page application (SPA) is deployed to Netlify:

![netlify-error](https://i.imgur.com/BKFNGzH.png "Netlify: Page Not Found error")

> **Page Not Found**
> Looks like you've followed a broken link or entered a URL that doesn't exist on this site.

The problem is that `react-router` creates the routes on the client side so when you visit pages other than the root (ex: `coolproject.netlify.com/about`), Netlify won't know how to redirect the route.

Luckily the solution for this is simple! We can use the [redirects API](https://www.netlify.com/docs/redirects/) provided by Netlify.

- Create a [`web/_redirects`](web/_redirects) to redirect all routes to the `index.html`:
  ```
  /*    /index.html   200
  ```
  - Creating files in the `web/` folder will copy them to the build folder (`web-build/`). Think of this like `public/` in Create React App projects.
- Now simply rebuild (`expo build:web`) and deploy your web app (`netlify deploy --dir web-build`)!
