# Starter Template with React Navigation

This is a minimal starter template for React Native apps using Expo and React Navigation.

## Launch your own

[![Launch with Expo](https://github.com/expo/examples/blob/master/.gh-assets/launch.svg?raw=true)](https://launch.expo.dev/?github=https://github.com/expo/examples/tree/master/with-react-navigation)

It includes the following:

- Example [Native Stack](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/native-stack-navigator) with a nested [Bottom Tab](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/bottom-tab-navigator)
- Web support with [React Native for Web](https://necolas.github.io/react-native-web/)
- TypeScript support and configured for React Navigation
- Automatic [deep link](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/deep-linking) and [URL handling configuration](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/configuring-links)
- Theme support [based on system appearance](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/themes/#using-the-operating-system-preferences)
- Expo [Development Build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/) with [Continuous Native Generation](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/continuous-native-generation/)
- Edge-to-edge configured on Android with [`react-native-edge-to-edge`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-edge-to-edge)

## Getting Started

1. Create a new project using this template:

   ```sh
   npx create-expo-app --example with-react-navigation
   yarn create expo-app --example with-react-navigation
   pnpm create expo-app --example with-react-navigation
   bun create expo-app --example with-react-navigation
   ```

## Running the app

- Install the dependencies:

  ```sh
  npx expo install
  ```

- Start the development server:

  ```sh
  npx expo start
  ```

- Build and run iOS and Android development builds:

  ```sh
  npm run ios
  # or
  npm run android
  ```

- In the terminal running the development server, press `i` to open the iOS simulator, `a` to open the Android device or emulator, or `w` to open the web browser.
