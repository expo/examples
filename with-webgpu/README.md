# Expo with WebGPU

Use [Expo Router](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction/) with [react-native-webgpu](https://github.com/wcandillon/react-native-webgpu) and Three.js to build cross-platform 3D and GPU-powered applications.

## Launch your own

[![Launch with Expo](https://github.com/expo/examples/blob/master/.gh-assets/launch.svg?raw=true)](https://launch.expo.dev/?github=https://github.com/expo/examples/tree/master/with-webgpu)

## 🚀 How to use

Bootstrap the project:

```sh
npx create-expo-app -e with-webgpu
```

Finally you can start the app with `npx expo run` — this project requires a custom client.

Deploy on all platforms with Expo Application Services (EAS).

- Deploy the website: `npx eas-cli deploy` — [Learn more](https://docs.expo.dev/eas/hosting/get-started/)
