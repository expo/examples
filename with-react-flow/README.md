![React Flow with Expo DOM Components Example](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/45459f24-3366-4ea8-809c-325d4b343f46)

Create **interactive flowcharts and diagrams** using the powerful combination of [React Flow](https://reactflow.dev/), [Expo DOM Components](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/dom-components/), and additional tools like **Expo Router**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Nativewind** for a seamless, customizable, and modern development experience.

This example demonstrates how to build engaging visual workflows in your Expo project with a fully styled and routed application setup.

## **üåü Features**

- **Interactive Flowcharts**: Leverage React Flow's versatile library to design and manage node-based workflows.
- **Cross-Platform Ready**: Use Expo DOM Components for seamless web-based Expo integration.
- **Expo Router Integration**: Navigate between screens with the robust, file-based routing system from Expo Router.
- **Tailwind CSS with Nativewind**: Style your components efficiently using Tailwind CSS and Nativewind for consistent design across platforms.
- **Customizable and Extendable**: Modify styles, nodes, edges, and interactions to match your needs.

## **üöÄ Quick Start**
