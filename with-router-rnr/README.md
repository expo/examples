# Expo Router and React Native Reusables

Use [Expo Router](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction/) with [React Native Reusables](https://github.com/mrzachnugent/react-native-reusables/tree/main) components. This works like a universal shadcn/ui, but for all platforms. It leverages nativewind for styling and combines a number of community libraries to provide a consistent experience across web, iOS, and Android.

## ðŸš€ How to use

```sh
npx create-expo-app -e with-router-rnr
```
