Video backgrounds are common in mobile apps. This shows you how to do it universally with Expo.

## How to use

Install: `yarn install`

[Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/workflow/expo-cli/): `npm install -g expo-cli` (if not already installed globally on your machine)

Run Project Locally: `expo start`
