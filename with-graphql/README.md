# GraphQL example

An example of using a graphQL API in your Expo Router project.

- create a graphQL api in your React Native codebase as an [API route](https://docs.expo.dev/router/reference/api-routes/)
- automatic type generation with [gql.tada](https://gql-tada.0no.co/)
- deploy it to EAS Hosting (for production use in your React Native app, website or both)
