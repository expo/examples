# Expo Router TV demo 👋

This is an Expo project that can be built for Apple TV and Android TV targets, and also supports mobile and web platforms.

In addition to Expo SDK packages, this project uses

- the [React Native TV fork](https://github.com/react-native-tvos/react-native-tvos), which supports both phone (Android and iOS) and TV (Android TV and Apple TV) targets
- the [React Native TV config plugin](https://github.com/react-native-tvos/config-tv/tree/main/packages/config-tv) to allow Expo prebuild to modify the project's native files for TV builds

The application code is based on the [revamped default project template](https://expo.dev/changelog/sdk-55-beta#revamped-default-project-template) introduced in SDK 55, with modifications and additions to support multiplatform development, including TV.

## 🚀 How to use

#### Creating a new project

- Create a project: `npx create-expo-app -e with-router-tv`
- `cd` into the project

- For TV development:

```sh
yarn
yarn prebuild:tv # Executes clean Expo prebuild with TV modifications
yarn ios # Build and run for Apple TV
yarn android # Build for Android TV
```
- For mobile development:

```sh
yarn
yarn prebuild # Executes Expo prebuild with no TV modifications
yarn ios # Build and run for iOS
yarn android # Build for Android mobile
```

- For web development:

```sh
yarn web # Run the project on web from localhost
```

> **_NOTE:_**
> Setting the environment variable `EXPO_TV=1` enables the `@react-native-tvos/config-tv` plugin to modify the project for TV.
> This can also be done by setting the parameter `isTV` to true in the `app.json`.

## Development

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

This project includes a [demo](./src/components/tv-event-demo.tsx) showing how to use React Native TV APIs to highlight controls as the user navigates the screen with the remote control.

## Deploy

Deploy on all platforms with Expo Application Services (EAS).

- Deploy the website: `npx eas-cli deploy` — [Learn more](https://docs.expo.dev/eas/hosting/get-started/)
- Deploy on iOS and Android using: `npx eas-cli build` — [Learn more](https://expo.dev/eas)

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
